  <h1 class="bear">The Coney Island Polar Bear Club</h1>
  <h2 class="bears">A Q&A With President Dennis Thomas</h2>
  <br><br><br><br>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col m6 offset-m3">
      <p>Few things personify off-season Coney Island like the Coney Island Polar Bear Club. Founded in 1903 by Bernaar McFadden, the Coney Island Polar Bear Club is the oldest winter bathing organization in the United States, and remains active to this day. 
      <br><br>
      The club meets every Sunday at the New York Aquarium’s Education Hall on the Coney Island boardwalk to run into the icy waves of the choppy Atlantic Ocean. The club is not open to the public (though interested parties may request permission to join the group for a guest swim), so I spoke with club president Dennis Thomas to learn more about the ins and outs of the iconic New York City organization.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col m6 offset-m3">
      <p class="question"><b>Can I first just ask how you got involved as president?</b></p>
      <p class="answer">Okay, well. I would say about thirty-five years ago or so, I was out at Coney Island - this was in the, I guess, 70’s because I was an art student going to college in New York, and used to hang out at Coney Island when it was probably at one of its lowest points, uh, pretty desolate, kind of a war zone. And I was out there on a winter day and saw these old guys standing on the beach: bathing suits, lifting rocks, and they went running into the water. And I stood there and thought, “That’s really crazy - I want to do that!” So I called them up, and they said come on and try it. I though I would only do it for one time – you know like most people jump out of an airplane with a parachute one time in their life and that’s enough, and so I did it, afterwards thought, “That’s not so bad, I should try that again.” And, went back and have been going back for thirty-five years.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="question"><b>Wow. For somebody like me, I just moved to New York where it gets super cold in the winter, so I don’t really have any experience with snow or anything like that so what is the appeal of running into the ocean in freezing temperatures?</b></p>
      <p class="answer">Well you know everyone has their own reasons. I’ll say that I’ve met a couple of people who have said to me they’ve always hated winter and wanted to find a way to like it - to have an activity they can only do it in winter, and thought that would help them, you know, enjoy the season more. And that kind of makes sense to me, “OK I’m going to do something in the winter that I can’t do any other time of the year and that allows me to look forward to that time of year.”

      Myself, it kind of clears my head. It’s so different from what we do every day, you know, this isn’t about jobs it’s not about the subway, it’s not about paying rent it’s not about parking, it’s not about relationships, it really is just about this experience of utter intensity and immediacy of you in the water. 

      Also I think a lot of people, whatever their initial impulses are, - I know a lot of our members kind of do it for the camaraderie of just a very incredible group very different people who wouldn’t meet in day-to-day life become together every Sunday and just have the best time together.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="question"><b>It sounds fun, it sounds very intense. So can you, like, walk me through, like, Sunday at Coney Island with the Polar Bear Club?</b></p>
      <p class="answer">Yeah we usually gather around noon to 12:30 at the Education Hall at the New York Aquarium, they let us use the space there for changing and meeting. Sometimes when it’s not available we meet at the boardwalk and use the bathhouses for changing but as often as not we’re at the aquarium. At one o’clock sharp we all kind of head down to the beach. We have a couple rituals; we form a big circle and do some jumping jacks to get the blood flowing. It’s not particularly rigorous, it’s just to, you know, moving around a bit, jumping up and down. After that, it’s into the water and we recommend that people get in kind of quickly don’t go <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rkyaUt7.jpg" class="ber">running and diving in knee-deep water; people get hurt that way. By the way, we do have lifeguards at every swim - two of them actually just cause we want to make sure everyone stays safe and don’t have any problems there. Once we’re in the water, again for thirty-five years I’ve known them, everybody forms a circle holding hands, and - which is kind of a bonding moment, experience, I don’t know. We’ve always done it, after that it’s free swim and you can stay there as long or as little as you like. A lot of us average about ten minutes at least each Sunday, regardless of the weather unless it’s really brutally cold we might go a little shorter. We don’t do this competitively, we always encourage people to get out when they’ve had enough, you know it’s not about challenging other people and being competitive and macho and ending up with hypothermia, you know we don’t want that. We kind of do this for fun and that’s how people - if it’s not fun get the hell out find something different. Afterwards we got back to the aquarium, people have coffee and tea and some light snacks and people change and either go home or go off into various small subgroups who will hang at Coney Island, get something to eat or things like that.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="question"><b>Do you ever notice that some days are more popular or less popular for some reason? You mentioned that on the colder days people don’t stay out at long – when do some people draw the line and are like, “Oh no, not today”?</b></p>
      <p class="answer">Actually I would say extremely rarely, like if we havea small attendance, a small turnout its probably because the swim is on thankgiving day weekend or the day after Christmas, you know, things like that people will , you know, have family responsibilities. We ususlaly get out 80 to 90 people a week, and that will endure even with the coldest weather. We’ve never cancelled a swim because of the weather, and generally people are gonna show up no matter what. You may stay in the water a little bit less time, or less time hanging out on the beach, but we’ve never cancelled a swim because of the weather itself. Just another side note to that, if there’s a snowstorm, youer going to have everyone coming out because people like surfing in the snow. Or if there’s a snowstorm on a weekday, whoever isn’t working and can take the time wil be out there at noon or one o clock, kind of an unofficial swim on a weekday just cause theres a blizzard people are gonna be out there cause its always more fun when its snowing.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="question"><b>And so, like, – this sounds silly – like I said I’m from the West Coast, so like there’s snow like the ocean? Like people are playing in slushy ocean water?</b></p>
      <p class="answer">No, no, it doesn’t freeze up like that, but its just , you’ll have snow on the beach, snow falling.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="question"><b>I saw that a lot of the sponsorships, or some of the money that’s raised by the polar bear club is given back to charities or the community in some way. Could you tell me a little bit mre about that?</b></p>
      <p class="answer">Yeah. Our New Year’s Day swim is a tradition goin back to 1903, and it is open to the public, anyone can join. It’s free of charge, but the past couple of years we have been partnering with various charities, that’s probably the last thirteen/fifteen years, and have raised over four hundred thousand dollars for these charities. And this year, we’re sending our support very directly towards the Coney Island community, supporting the Alliance for Coney Island, the New York Aquarium, and a few other community and arts groups within the Coney Island area. So, we expect to raise somewhere around eighty thousand dollars. If last year’s numbers still hold true, we will have about twenty five hundred people swimming, and probably close to ten thousand spectators on the beach, so it’s a pretty big day for the winter out on Coney Island on New Year’s Day.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="question"><b>And you said that event is open to the public?</b></p>
      <p class="anwer">Yes, anyone is welcome to join, and again there’s no fee, but we do request donations to help support charities within the community. And people are quite good about helping out.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="question"><b>And so, like, are regular weekly swims – because it’s the Coney Island Polar Bear Club – as far as membership goes, or participating on a weekly basis, is that also open to the public or do you have to be a member, or how does that happen?</b></p>
      <p class="answer">It is a private club, and you have to generally be amember to swim with us on a regular basis. We do allow the public to do one guest swim with us during a season as well as New Year’s Day’s swim. We do take a few new members each year, and we lose a few each year. Right now, we’re kind of at capacity, with space we need in the Aquarium, and it starts to get too crowded, and people don’t – once the club gets too big, people don’t get to know each other and get aquainted and you feel like youre swimming with a bunch of strangers, so we’ve kind of restricted the amount of members, and really aren’t quite as open as we used to be with membership cause we’re, there’s been too many people which I never thought would happen. The way I look at it is, well you know it’s a big ocean, there’s a lot of beach there, and any other group is welcome to form their own club and swim any time they want.  We don’t have to be the only game in town. It’d be great if there are other groups doing it as well. But right now, we just can’t take on all the people who would like to be a part of us, which is fascinating. I never thought we’d be turning people away.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="question"><b>That kind of leads into my next question, so, like, are there any other – because I know that the Coney Island Polar Bear Club, like you said, it’s the oldest winter bathing organization in the U.S., so are there any other clubs in New York City that kind of do what you guys do? Like if somebody can’t, for whatever reason join the Coney Island Polar Bear Club, is there another club or any other clubs you know of that do the same thing?</b></p>
      <p class="answer">Not that I am currently aware of, there used to be a couple of other smaller groups that met, but currently I am not aware of anyone. There might be a group down in Brighton Beach, the Arctic Ice Bears, I believe they were called, and I don’t know if they’re still around. It’s a small group of probably eight people, a few years ago. And you know, one thing, difference I would say there is between our group and many others is that, you know, in the past decade polar plunges have become a new fundraising opportunity for various groups like Special Olympics, organizing things across the country, and most of those are one day a year, single event that’s based around fundraising, and one of the things different about the Coney Island Polar Bear Club is, while we do do that one day of fundraising, we really are a regular club meeting every week, and swimming every week, out of commitment to that idea of cold water instead of a one a year deal.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="question"><b>And also just kind of going back to, you know, why running into the water, I read – and correct me if I’m wrong – but that the club was founded by a health advocate. So, like, what are the health benefits of doing what the Polar Bear Club does every week?</b></p>
      <p class="answer">Yeah, I don’t know if I can attest to anything credibly, you know I think most of the health benefits that are talked about are anecdotal at best, I know Bernaar McFadden who founded the club, winter swimming was great to add to a male’s virility, I can’t attest to that, per se. I tend to – my own story would be I tend to get fewer colds in the winter than I used to, and when I do get a cold it doesn’t last as long, and whether that’s attributable to age or winter swimming I can’t say. I’ve gone in with the worst colds I’ve had, I’ve gone in with walking pneumonia, has it made it better, has it made it worse? But I also heard other members say, “Oh it cures cancer! It’ll restore any illness you have!” However, we have to take all those claims with a grain of salt.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="question"><b>Kind of just to tie if off, what I’m trying to do here is – what my class is looking at is how different aspects of New York City life play into the theme of identity. So what role do you think the Polar Bear Club has in relation to the way New Yorkers perceive their own identity or the identity of New York City?</b></p>
      <p class="answer">I’m trying to wrap my head around what you’re really asking, maybe I’ll just start <img src="https://i.imgur.com/R1ljd71.jpg" class="bers"> rambling and see if that goes in the right direction along terms of identity. One way I might approach it is, in terms of New York City, I think Coney Island over the years has really been a place of weirdness, where it’s been developed, where it’s been encouraged, and has a history of weirdness. I tend to think that for the Coney Island Polar Bear Club, part of that history contributes to it, and the people that I know from being out there for so many years, all appreciate this idea, within New York City, which might be a very strange place to being with, this is a stranger place in New York City, and I think most people that feel some kinship with Coney Island kind of appreciate this off-beat weirdness that has always been part of this area of New York. 
      <br><br>
      I could also talk about identity in terms of, in terms of the club – and I alluded to this earlier – we have people from all different ages, from kids up into I’d say seventies maybe even eighty, I don’t know how old our oldest member is right now, and we have professionals people, we have lawyers, we have tradesmen, we have hipsters… and just a wide array of really different people who would not socialize together on a daily basis in New York City. And then when they come together, people have referred to this group as their second family, which is kind of unintended, and I kind of spontaneous. I don’t know what we’ve done to create or encourage that except try to provide a good environment where people can come and swim in the winter, but there’s a surprising bond among all these very different people, and maybe its just cause its harsh, cause its cold, cause you’re doing something so counterintuitive that you just feel you’re part of a very special group because you share this intense experience together. I’m not sure, but that’s kind of a sense of identity that I think the people in the club have or the activity that they do based on all the different kind of areas and backgrounds they’re coming from in New York City, does that make sense?</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="question"><b>No, yeah absolutely.</b></p>
