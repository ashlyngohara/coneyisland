				<p>At the turn of the century, Coney Island dazzled people all around the world. Intended to be an escape from the dreariness caused by industrialization in cities, Coney Island was part amusement part, part beach resort, and part cultural hub. Its absurdity attracted people of all social classes, races, and genders, and in turn became one of the most crucial social phenomenons in American history. 
				<br><br>
				Coney Island today is certainly a much different place than it was in the late eighteen hundreds, and it is that much more different during its off season, when patrons don parkas instead of swimsuits, when they observe Luna Park from afar instead of up close, and when they come for reasons other than rollercoasters and ice cream cones. 
				<br><br>
				Coney Island during the off-season is eery. Everywhere you look, hooded figures bow their heads against the wind, hungry seagulls make guttural shrieks as they patrol the boardwalk, and always the skeletons of the Cyclone and the Wonder Wheel loom in the background - a haunting scene that both intrigues and frightens me. 
				<br><br>
				During off-season, Coney Island suffers from absence in every way. The colors are paler, the crowds are thinner, and beaches are barer. It is specifically this absence I strive to create with "Off Season," through a combination of visual, auditory, and textual narratives. 
				<br><br>
				Thank you for visiting, come again soon.
