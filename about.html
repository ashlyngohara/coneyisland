  			<p>My name is Ashlyn O'Hara and I am currently a first-year student at The New School in New York City where I study Journalism + Design and Politics at the Eugene Lang College for Liberal Arts. I moved to New York City in August from San Diego, California, where I have lived my entire life. The Pacific Ocean always played a prominent role in my life; it served as the backdrop for everything from my childhood summers to my graduation photos. It felt really awful to leave it behind when I moved.
  			<br><br>
			For this project, I knew I wanted to focus on something related to the ocean or beach, eager to fill the Pacific Ocean sized hole that appeared within me over the summer. There is perhaps no greater place in New York City more emblematic of a "beach scene" than Coney Island. I built my project around my subject, striving to recreate the same feeling, aesthetic, and atmosphere one experiences walking around an oceanside amusement park almost entirely devoid of people. It's beautiful, it's haunting, and it's begging to be explored. Through photography, text, and ambient noise I attempt to do this.
